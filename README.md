# Comprehensive Machine Learning and Data Mining Analysis: IBM HR Attrition, Medical Costs, and Association Rule Mining

# Project Overview

This project involves the application of machine learning and data mining techniques across three unique datasets to solve real-world business problems. The analyses focus on understanding employee attrition, predicting medical insurance costs, and identifying associations between customer viewing preferences.

# Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, as well as association rule mining, to derive meaningful insights from three datasets:

## IBM HR Attrition Dataset: K-means clustering and DBSCAN clustering predict employee attrition.
## Medical Cost Dataset: A regression task to predict health insurance charges.
## Customer Viewing Dataset: An association rule mining task to identify viewer preferences.

The goal is to apply appropriate machine learning techniques, optimize models, and provide
actionable insights for decision-making.

# Datasets
## IBM HR Attrition Dataset: Contains features such as age, work experience, job level, overtime status, and attrition.
## Medical Cost Dataset: Includes demographic and lifestyle features (e.g., age, BMI, smoking status) and the target variable, charges.
## Customer Viewing Dataset: Contains viewing preferences for various shows.

# Part 1: IBM HR Attrition Case Study
## Objective
Predict employee attrition and identify key factors influencing it.
## Techniques
Data Preprocessing: Conversion of categorical features into numerical, removal of low-correlation features.
Visualization: Box plots, bar plots, and correlation heatmaps to identify key factors such as overtime and salary.
Classification Models:
Random Forest: Achieved 86.14% accuracy.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Achieved 84.51% accuracy.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Achieved 86% accuracy.
Clustering: Applied k-means and DBSCAN clustering to identify employee groups based on income and tenure.
# Part 2: Medical Cost Dataset
## Objective
Predict health insurance charges and understand the impact of demographic and lifestyle factors.
Techniques
Data Preprocessing: Conversion of categorical features into numerical, removal of less correlated features.
Visualization: Scatter plots to study relationships between smoking status, BMI, age, and charges.
Regression Model:
Multiple Linear Regression: Achieved an RÂ² score of 0.778, indicating that 77.8% of variance in charges is explained by the model.

# Part 3: Association Rule Mining
## Objective
Discover patterns in viewing preferences and provide recommendations.
Techniques
Apriori Algorithm:
Rule 1: Viewers of Ozark are likely to watch Demon Slayer (Lift: 3.09).
Rule 2: Viewers of Mr. Robot are likely to watch Ozark (Lift: 2.35).
Rule 3: Viewers of Mr. Robot are likely to watch Stranger Things (Lift: 3.16).

# Results and Insights
IBM HR Attrition:

Employees working overtime, particularly at lower job levels with low salaries, are more likely to leave.
Random Forest and SVM performed slightly better in predicting attrition.
Medical Cost Prediction:

Smoking status is the most significant factor influencing medical charges.
Age and BMI also contribute to higher costs.
Association Rule Mining:

Viewing preferences can be clustered to improve recommendation systems.
Popular shows like Ozark and Mr. Robot indicate strong associations with other titles.
# Future Work
IBM HR Attrition: Explore additional machine learning models and ensemble techniques.
Medical Cost Prediction: Test advanced regression models such as XGBoost or Random Forest Regression.
Association Rule Mining: Test other algorithms like FP-Growth for scalability and efficiency.
# Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, mlxtend
